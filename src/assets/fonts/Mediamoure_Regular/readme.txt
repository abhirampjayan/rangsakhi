I released my first typeface "Mediamoure" totally free on the site of my magazine MEDIAMOURE! Inspired by the titles of old newspapers and the inaccuracies of typeface printing, this typeface brings a unique trait to your projects!

It can also be used for commercial purposes yes :) 
A little mention would be appreciated, and do not hesitate to send me the visuals on Instagram @mediamoure :)
